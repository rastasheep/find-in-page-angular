Place for forging UI element samples mostly with Angular JS.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open an element's subfolder.
3. Run index.html

## ES2015 and ES5 Transpilation

Please note: these samples are written in ES2015 and, as such,
require [direct browser support](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/).
You can transpile the examples with [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/cli/):

```bash
babel --presets=es2015 find-in-page/application.js --out-file find-in-page/application-es5.js
```

But to keep things as simple as possible for everyone, that's out of scope for this set of samples.
